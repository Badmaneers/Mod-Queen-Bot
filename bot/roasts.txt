You're like a cloud... when you disappear, it's a beautiful day!
You have something on your chin... no, the third one down.
You're proof that not everyone should have access to WiFi.
Your secrets are safe with me. I never even listen when you tell me them.
I'd agree with you, but then we’d both be wrong.
You're like a software update... whenever you show up, everything crashes.
You bring everyone so much joy—when you leave the room.
You're like a cloud of smoke—annoying and hard to get rid of.
I thought I had seen it all, but then you spoke.
I'd explain it to you, but I left my crayons at home.
